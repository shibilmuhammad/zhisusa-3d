# ✅ Outdoor Workspace & Fixed Camera Zoom Timing

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Camera Zoom Timing** ✅

#### **LIVE Section** - Now Zooms to Cottage
- Camera position: `[8, 4, 11]` (closer to cottage)
- Target: `[0, 1.8, 0]` (cottage center)
- FOV: 50° (tighter framing)
- **Result**: Smooth zoom to cottage when scrolling reaches LIVE section!

#### **WORK Section** - Now Zooms to Workspace
- Camera position: `[-6, 2.5, 8]` (viewing workspace from side)
- Target: `[-4, 1.2, 3]` (outdoor workspace table)
- FOV: 45° (focus on work setup)
- **Result**: Zooms to person working at outdoor desk!
