## 🎯 Camera Positions Configured

### Welcome Section (Distant Forest View)
```typescript
cameraPosition: [15, 8, 20]    // Far away, elevated
cameraTarget: [0, 1.5, 0]      // Looking at cottage
cameraFov: 65                   // Wide angle for forest view
modelRotation: [0, Math.PI * 0.15, 0]  // Slight angle
```

### Live Section (Zoom In)
```typescript
cameraPosition: [10, 5, 14]    // Closer, medium distance
cameraTarget: [0, 1.5, 0]      // Still centered on cottage
cameraFov: 55                   // Tighter framing
modelRotation: [0, Math.PI * 0.2, 0]   // Better view angle
```

### Work Section (Close-up)
```typescript
cameraPosition: [4, 3, 6]      // Very close
cameraTarget: [0, 2, 0]        // Looking at windows

## 🎛️ Customization Options

### Adjust Zoom Distance
Edit `src/animations/constants.ts` line 29:

```typescript
// Make it more distant
cameraPosition: [20, 10, 25]  // Further away

// Or closer starting point
cameraPosition: [12, 6, 16]   // Less dramatic zoom
```

### Change Forest Density
Edit `src/components/3DScenes/models/ForestEnvironment.tsx` line 14:

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++) {  // More trees
for (let i = 0; i < 15; i++) {  // Fewer trees
```

### Adjust Tree Distance
Edit `ForestEnvironment.tsx` line 16:

```typescript
const minDistance = 8;  // Trees further from cottage
const minDistance = 5;  // Trees closer to cottage
```

### Change Tree Colors
Edit `ForestEnvironment.tsx` lines 71-93:

```typescript
// Lighter green forest
color="#4a6a32"  // Instead of "#2d5016"

// Darker, moodier forest
color="#1a3a10"  // Instead of "#2d5016"
```

### Add More Elements
